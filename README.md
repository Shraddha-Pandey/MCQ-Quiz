# MCQ-Quiz

This provides a program that can run from the command prompt and simulates a quiz-like environment. The questions are multiple choice questions and are presented to the user one at a time. The number of questions to be asked can be set by the user, and the questions are randomly picked from the JSON file. Upon seeing the question and its answers, the user gets to enter their choice and is then told if the answer picked is right or wrong. At the end of the quiz, the program also shows the total score obtained by the user.

To run the program from the command prompt:
1. Use the "cd" command to navigate to the directory where the python and the json file are stored   (they must be in the same directory)
   ex : cd C:\Users\<UserName>\Desktop
2. Run the python script using the command:
   python main.py
